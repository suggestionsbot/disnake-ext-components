.. _disnake-ext-components: https://github.com/DisnakeCommunity/disnake-ext-components

Welcome to the examples section of our docs.
Basic understanding of python and the usage of disnake's components is considered pre-knowledge for these examples, along with some familiarity with |attrs|_ classes or dataclasses.
If this is your first time using *ext-components*, we recommend looking at the :ref:`Quickstart Guide <quickstart>`.
The examples aim to show you how some of the features of this extension can be used and implemented.

These examples are also available on our :github-blob:`GitHub repository <>` without documentation, and are perfectly runnable as-is.
The easiest way of running the examples is:

1. Clone the repository,
2. Run ``poetry install`` to install dependencies,
3. Copy ``.env.example`` and name it ``.env``,
4. Enter your bot token in the new ``.env`` file,
5. Run ``poetry run example <name>``.

If you think an example is unclear or an example for a feature is missing, feel free to open a :github:`pull request <pulls>` or :github:`issue <issues>`!
